## GIA Report Results API

The GIA Report Results API provides programmatic access to results issued on GIA's natural diamond, colored diamond, laboratory-grown diamond, colored stones, and pearl reports. 

The API returns links to the PDF facsimile of the report and any other available assets. Depending on the report type, this may include plotting diagrams, proportion diagrams, images, and videos of the item.
